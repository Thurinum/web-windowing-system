# web-windowing-system
A very basic but flexible JS-powered windowing system.

This little project brings a flexible, desktop-like windowing system to the web.  
It actually started as a refactoring of a terrible fake online Windows XP clone I had made years ago.  
I ended up rewriting most of the windowing logic, so why not post it :)

## Features
- Configurable (albeit ugly) app menu
- Configurable context menu system (kind of useless at the moment)
- Taskbar with working active windows labels and realtime clock
- Windows that can be moved, resized (buggy), minimized, maximized, closed and handle mouse focus.

> Note: I do plan to remove the Windows XP theme eventually. Got to get rid of those proprietary assets...
